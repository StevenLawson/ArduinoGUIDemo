This project is a demo that shows how to create a Java Swing GUI application that will communicate with an Arduino over a COM port.

I used Netbeans for the Java side of the programming.

Once you open the project in Netbeans, do a "Build". The POM is configured to create an EXE file in the "target" folder that can be easily deployed to any computer with JRE 8.
