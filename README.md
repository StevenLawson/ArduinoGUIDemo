This project demonstrates a Java Swing GUI application communicating with an Arduino over a COM port.

Netbeans is used for the Java programming. One you open the project, do a "Build". The POM is configured to create an EXE file in the "target" folder that can be easily deployed to any computer with JRE 8.

The "ArduinoGUIDemo.ino" file contains the Arduino code, and can be programmed via the Arduino IDE to an Arduino device.
